            <h1>WHO WE ARE ?</h1>
            <p>
                Since 1990, Amoeba Music has welcomed independent music lovers of
                all kinds to our unique, vibrant stores in Berkeley, San Francisco
                and Hollywood. We stock every kind of music and movies -- from the
                top 40 to the best in underground rock and hip-hop, soul,
                electronica, new and classic jazz, world music, roots music and
                experimental music. We also have the biggest, most diverse and
                affordable selection of DVDs and vinyl LPs found anywhere. Since
                we're a trading post for new and used discs, our stock changes
                daily, and just about anything you're looking for can be found here.
                We're more than just a record store -- we're a 21st century music
                outlet, a website, a popular live performance venue, and together
                with our customers we're a meeting place for California's most
                colorful community of progressive and creative minds.
